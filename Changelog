# HELIX-MTRIG Changelog

* 6/14/18: Switched LVDS buffers to a combination of DS15BR400 (for powerdown capability) and FIN1101 (cost/power).
* 7/13/18: Near-final schematic...
* 7/24/18: Final schematic, layout complete.
* 7/30/18: Fix U2 footprint (top/bottom pins were wrong size).
           Move V5/V10 to topside for easier heatsinking.
           Add top layer ground pour around crystal shield.
           Fix U70/U68/R137/R139 refdes.
           Fix U76 refdes.
           Fix C47 refdes and a few missing FPGA decoupling cap labels.
* 8/10/18: Realign U68 to make Ian happy.
           Fix meanders in a few places where PADS is a pain in the neck.
           Fix a few 0402 resistor/cap spacings where they were too close (based on physical mock)
           Fix missing solder mask opening on bottom (based on physical mock)
           Add a copper pour near the front of the Mini-SAS HD connectors for the springs to make contact
           with (based on physical mock).
* 8/14/18: Add V9/R48/CX260, voltage reference option for VCTCXO.
           Fix U10 (ATRG fanout) enable pin connections (connect 1,2,4,6,8, leave 3,5,7 unused)
           Add R190/R192/R193 for input voltage lockouts (only turn on for 3.48 < Vin < 5.69 )
           Add copper keep-outs near edge of board to ensure return currents flow through supplies.
           Changed board-to-copper clearance to 8 mil (Bittele spec), moved stitching vias to accomodate.
           Moved copper keep-out on the top in a bit to keep 3.3V connectivity better.
